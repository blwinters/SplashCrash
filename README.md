# SplashCrash

This is a minimal crash reproduction, created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

It seems that adding `expo-dev-client` to a vanilla Expo project causes a crash in local builds due to not finding the splash screen. I'm not sure when this was introduced, but it exists in v4.0.28.

## Reproduction steps

1. `npm install`
2. `npx expo prebuild`
3. `npx expo run:ios` (This should run fine)
4. `ctrl-c` to stop the app
5. `npx expo run:ios` (This will crash with the error below)

## Removing the crash

After reproducing the crash,

1. Remove `expo-dev-client` from `package.json`
2. `npm install`
3. `npx expo prebuild --clean`
4. Delete `DerivedData` (`~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/SplashCrash*`)
5. Delete app from simulator
6. `npx expo run:ios` (This should now run fine multiple times in a row)
